# fwi-lsqrtm-python

This repository provides simple Python implementations of least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) and full-waveform inversion (FWI) for TTI- and (visco)acoustic
media. The implementations of both inversion workflows are based on the Devito, sotb-wrapper and Dask libraries. 2-D TTI Marmousi model, 2-D TTI Overthrust model and 
the 2-D TTI Marmousi II model are used to prove the robustness of the implementations.
